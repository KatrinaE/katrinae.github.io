	<h2>My Seating Chart Software Saga
	</h2>
	<h5>Sun 02 March 2014</h5>
	<p>For the first few weeks of Hacker School, I've been working on a
project that began last summer, when I volunteered to help out
one of my husband's co-workers. She's responsible for putting together
the seating chart for a five-day-long conference every year. She spends 
a week obsessing
over it, making sure that people don't sit together too frequently and
that they don't get trapped in the back corner every day. 
I jumped at the chance to automate the seating chart's
creation, thinking it would take me a weekend.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. I did crank out a disgusting-looking script in time 
for the conference, but my approach - a basic greedy strategy - didn't
achieve perfection, and I had no idea what would be better. My husband's
co-worker was grateful but disappointed. I was
vaguely ashamed. Still, she liked it
well enough that she asked for it so she could use it again next year.</p>
<p>At that point I was embarrassed at the mere thought of anyone else
ever laying eyes on the code, so I started cleaning it up - but I
still had no idea about how to improve my results. It distressed
me that I couldn't prove whether or not there was an optimal solution,
or even figure out how many possibilities there were. I tried
several times, but my math skills just weren't up to it.</p>
<p>Gripped by my problem, I bought
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844">CLRS</a>
and took an undergrad algorithms course (it was disappointing). I got the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=pd_sim_b_4/187-1310092-7742419?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1D6919RZAFGT9RXXAP9W">Algorithm Design Manual</a>,
which seemed like it would be useful, but by then my free time had decreased
and I had to table the project until Hacker School began.</p>
<p>By the time I was there, I had decided that <a href="/sim-anneal-overview.html">simulated annealing</a>
might be what I wanted. HS resident
Greg agreed that this was a good strategy, and I set out to implement it.
My early results were discouraging. I was now using an appropriate
algorithm, but my seating charts were no better than the ones I
had generated using my na&iuml;ve one. </p>
<p>I kept tweaking the annealing parameters, though, and
started to make some progress. I eventually got to a point
where I was consistently achieving costs between 60 and 100, which
was amazing compared to the 2,000 - 5,000 range of my greedy
strategy, to say nothing of the cost of random solutions, which could range into the millions.</p>
<p>And then one day, riding home on the train,
I made a minor change, re-ran the program, and saw:</p>
<p><img alt="Achieving zero cost" src="/images/zero_cost.png" /></p>
<p>!!! </p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. 8 months after I'd happened upon this problem,
I'd finally found what I was looking for. It wasn't a fluke
- subsequent runs confirmed that my program really did work.</p>
<p>Of course, to make this a deliverable application, 
there's still a lot to do: make it faster, build a GUI
(gulp), write documentation, achieve reasonable test
coverage... </p>
<p>This isn't paid work - the repo is <a href="https://github.com/KatrinaE/seating">on Github</a>
- so in a way it's tempting to put it aside now that I've
conquered the part of it that was so vexing. Now, 
though, I don't think I'll be satisfied until
I can put a stamp on this project and say 'done'. In its current form,
the code is really 'for' this one person (because a
fair amount is hard-coded into it), and I almost feel like it
would be rude for me to have worked on her fun problem all year 
without giving her anything in return. </p>
<p>So my plan is
to get all of those things done within the next few months
- in time for this year's conference.</p>
