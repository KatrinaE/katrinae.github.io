    <h2>My Seating Chart Software Saga</h2>
  	<h6>Written by <a href="/author/katrina-ellison-geltman.html">Katrina Ellison Geltman</a> on Sun 02 March 2014.</h6>
	<p>For the first few weeks of Hacker School, I've been working on a project that
began last summer, when I volunteered to help out one of my husband's co-
workers. She's responsible for putting together the seating chart for a five-
day-long conference every year. She spends a week obsessing over it, making
sure that people don't sit together too frequently and that they don't get
trapped in the back corner every day. I jumped at the chance to automate the
seating chart's creation, thinking it would take me a weekend.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. I did crank out a disgusting-looking script in time for the
conference, but my approach - a basic greedy strategy - didn't achieve
perfection, and I had no idea what would be better. My husband's co-worker was
grateful but disappointed. I was vaguely ashamed. Still, she liked it well
enough that she asked for it so she could use it again next year.</p>
<p>At that point I was embarrassed at the mere thought of anyone else ever laying
eyes on the code, so I started cleaning it up - but I still had no idea about
how to improve my results. It distressed me that I couldn't prove whether or
not there was an optimal solution, or even figure out how many possibilities
there were. I tried several times, but my math skills just weren't up to it.</p>
<p>Gripped by my problem, I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-
Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844">CLRS</a> and took an undergrad algorithms
course (it was disappointing). I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-
Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=pd_sim_b_4/187-1310092-7742419?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1D6919RZAFGT9RXXAP9W">Algorithm Design
Manual</a>,
which seemed like it would be useful, but by then my free time had decreased
and I had to table the project until Hacker School began.</p>
<p>By the time I was there, I had decided that <a href="/sim-anneal-
overview.html">simulated annealing</a> might be what I wanted. HS resident Greg agreed that this was a
good strategy, and I set out to implement it. My early results were
discouraging. I was now using an appropriate algorithm, but my seating charts
were no better than the ones I had generated using my naive one.</p>
<p>I kept tweaking the annealing parameters, though, and started to make some
progress. I eventually got to a point where I was consistently achieving costs
between 60 and 100, which was amazing compared to the 2,000 - 5,000 range of
my greedy strategy, to say nothing of the cost of random solutions, which
could range into the millions.</p>
<p>And then one day, riding home on the train, I made a minor change, re-ran the
program, and saw:</p>
<p><img alt="Achieving zero cost" src="/images/zero_cost.png"></p>
<p>!!!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. 8 months after I'd happened upon this problem, I'd
finally found what I was looking for. It wasn't a fluke - subsequent runs
confirmed that my program really did work.</p>
<p>Of course, to make this a deliverable application, there's still a lot to do:
make it faster, build a GUI (gulp), write documentation, achieve reasonable
test coverage...</p>
<p>This isn't paid work - the repo is <a href="https://github.com/KatrinaE/seating">on
Github</a> - so in a way it's tempting to
put it aside now that I've conquered the part of it that was so vexing. Now,
though, I don't think I'll be satisfied until I can put a stamp on this
project and say 'done'. In its current form, the code is really 'for' this one
person (because a fair amount is hard-coded into it), and I almost feel like
it would be rude for me to have worked on her fun problem all year without
giving her anything in return.</p>
<p>So my plan is to get all of those things done within the next few months - in
time for this year's conference.</p>
